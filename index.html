    <h1>Missile Man Of India</h1>
    <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of
    India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of
    Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen
    Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited
    Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had
    been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his
    ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was
    poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who
    claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
    and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy
    he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the
    mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from
    the ancestral home.
